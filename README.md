# Introduction

Diving into the job market.I focus on data analyst roles exploring top paying jobs , in demand skills and where demand meets high salary expectations in data analytics
Here are the sql queries:[project_sql folder](/project_sql/)

# Background

Data comes from https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql .It is packed with insights on job titles, salaries locations and essential skills.

### Quetions I wanted to answer through the queries

1.What are the top paying data analyst roles?

2.What skills are required for these top paying jobs?

3.What skills are the most in demand ?

4.Which skills are asociated with higher salaries?

5.what are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I used

- SQL : Did the majority of the analysis allowing me to query the database and come up with critical insights.

- Visual studio code : used to execute SQL queries.

- Git & Github : Used for verion control and sharing my sql scripts.

# The Analysis

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here’s how I approached each question:

**1.Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs**
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

**2.Skills for Top Paying Jobs**
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for the top 10 highest paying data analyst jobs in 2023:

SQL is leading with a bold count of 8.

Python follows closely with a bold count of 7.

Tableau is also highly sought after, with a bold count of 6.

Other skills like R, Snowflake, Pandas, and Excel show varying degrees of demand.

**3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts**
This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.SQL and Excel remain fundamental, emphasizing the need for strong foundational skills in data processing and spreadsheet manipulation.
Programming and Visualization Tools like Python, Tableau, and Power BI are essential, pointing towards the increasing importance of technical skills in data storytelling and decision support.

**4. Skills Based on Salary**
Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.

Pay is driven by specialization, not core analytics
The highest salaries are tied to niche or advanced skills (e.g., blockchain, MLOps, infrastructure tools), not traditional analyst staples like SQL or Excel—showing that rare expertise commands a premium.

Strong convergence between data analysis and engineering/ML
Many top-paying skills sit at the intersection of analytics, machine learning, and data engineering (modeling frameworks, orchestration tools, scalable systems), indicating analysts are increasingly expected to work closer to production systems.

Enterprise & automation tools signal seniority
Skills related to infrastructure, automation, and collaboration platforms correlate with higher pay, reflecting that top-earning analysts often operate in senior, platform-level, or decision-critical roles, not purely reporting roles.

**5. Most Optimal Skills to Learn**
Combining insights from demand and salary data, this query aimed to pinpoint skills that are both in high demand and have high salaries, offering a strategic focus for skill development.

High-Demand Programming Languages: Python and R stand out for their high demand, with demand counts of 236 and 148 respectively. Despite their high demand, their average salaries are around $101,397 for Python and $100,499 for R, indicating that proficiency in these languages is highly valued but also widely available.

Cloud Tools and Technologies: Skills in specialized technologies such as Snowflake, Azure, AWS, and BigQuery show significant demand with relatively high average salaries, pointing towards the growing importance of cloud platforms and big data technologies in data analysis.

Business Intelligence and Visualization Tools: Tableau and Looker, with demand counts of 230 and 49 respectively, and average salaries around $99,288 and $103,795, highlight the critical role of data visualization and business intelligence in deriving actionable insights from data.

Database Technologies: The demand for skills in traditional and NoSQL databases (Oracle, SQL Server, NoSQL) with average salaries ranging from $97,786 to $104,534, reflects the enduring need for data storage, retrieval, and management expertise.

# What I learned

Complex Query Crafting: Mastered the art of advanced SQL, merging tables like a pro and wielding WITH clauses .

Data Aggregation: Got cozy with GROUP BY and turned aggregate functions like COUNT() and AVG() into my data-summarizing sidekicks.

Analytical Wizardry: Leveled up my real-world puzzle-solving skills, turning questions into actionable, insightful SQL queries.

# Conclusions

1.Most In-Demand Skills: SQL is also the most demanded skill in the data analyst job market, thus making it essential for job seekers.

2.Optimal Skills for Job Market Value: SQL leads in demand and offers for a high average salary, positioning it as one of the most optimal skills for data analysts to learn to maximize their market value.
